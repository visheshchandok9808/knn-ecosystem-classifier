# ðŸ¤– KNN Classifier â€“ Social Network Ads Analysis

Welcome to the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier** project!  
This interactive machine learning project predicts whether a user purchases a product based on their age and estimated salary â€” using real-world social network ad data.

## ðŸ“Š Project Description

This project uses the **KNN algorithm** for binary classification on the classic `Social_Network_Ads.csv` dataset.  
It is deployed through a **Streamlit app** allowing you to try out predictions live!
